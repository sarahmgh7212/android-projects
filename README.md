# android-projects
In this project we built an Android mobile application, in which you could select a movie and create an event 
(event attributes include: time,location,movie name) 
then add attendees from your phone contacts, and display the location of the event on Google Map.
Movie attributes (movie name, director, image) are added from a text file and then stored in the database after starting the application.

Tech stack used:
•	Sqlite
•	Google Map API
•	Android Studio (Java)
•	MVC pattern
